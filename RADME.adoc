=== Running the app

Verifying issues addressed by this issue: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/issues/682

Go to the root of the repository.

Make sure you have Kafka broker running. The application expects it to be on defaults (localhost:9092). If thats not the case, change the configuration.

`./mvnw clean package`

Start the application preferrably in an IDE.

Watch the logs on startup to examine the topology generated.
